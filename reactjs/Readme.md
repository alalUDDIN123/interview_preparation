  - ReactJS is a JavaScript library used to build reusable UI components with a virtual DOM.

# 2.No
  - State is used to manage internal data within a component and is mutable
  - `Props are used to pass data between components and are read-only`
  - State should only be used within the declaring component
  - `while props are used to configure child components`

  - Pure component only re-renders when its props or state have changed, optimizing performance in ReactJS.

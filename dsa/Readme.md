## Answer :::
# 1_No
- Answer: A data structure is a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. It provides a way to manage and store data, as well as perform operations on the data.
---
# 2_No
- An Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be executed in a certain order to get the desired output.
---
# 3_No
- Data structure availability may vary by programming languages. Mostly used data structures are 
   - `list`
   - `arrays`
   - `stack`
   - `queues`
   - `graph`
   - `tree`
   - `Binary Search Trees`
   - `Hash Tables`

# 4_No
- No, A string is a sequence of characters that represents text. In JavaScript, strings are declared using either single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...").
  - Some of the most common uses  string methods mentioned here with examples

      - `charAt(index)`: Returns the character at the specified index in a string.

      - `concat(str1, str2, ...)`: Concatenates two or more strings together and returns the resulting string.

      - `indexOf(substring, startIndex)`: Searches a string for a specified substring and returns the index of the first occurrence (starting from the specified index if provided).

      - `lastIndexOf(substring, startIndex)`: Searches a string for a specified substring and returns the index of the last occurrence (starting from the specified index if provided).

      - `replace(oldValue, newValue)`: Replaces all occurrences of a specified value in a string with another specified value.

      - `slice(startIndex, endIndex)`: Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string (the original string is not modified).

      - `split(separator, limit)`: Splits a string into an array of substrings based on a specified separator and returns the array.

      - `substring(startIndex, endIndex)`: Extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string (the original string is not modified).

      - `toLowerCase()`: Converts all characters in a string to lowercase and returns the resulting string.

      - `toUpperCase()`: Converts all characters in a string to uppercase and returns the resulting string.

      - `trim()`: Removes whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) from the beginning and end of a string and returns the resulting string.

      - `startsWith(searchString, position)`: Determines whether a string begins with a specified substring and returns true or false.

      - `endsWith(searchString, position)`: Determines whether a string ends with a specified substring and returns true or false.

      - `includes(searchString, position)`: Determines whether a string contains a specified substring and returns true or false.

      - `match(regexp)`: Searches a string for a specified pattern (regular expression) and returns an array of matching substrings.

# 5_No:
 - It's a general problem-solving approach in computer science and algorithms, where a problem is solved by trying all possible solutions, without relying on any specialized knowledge or algorithmic techniques.

---
# 6_No:
 - Sorting is the process to arrange data in a particaular format or in a order.There are many different sorting techniques. 
   - Some of the most common uses techniques mentioned here.
     - `Bubble sorting` : It works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are not in order. 
        -  `Time complexity`: Ο(n2)
        
     - `Selection Sort` : Selection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning. 
        -  `Time complexity`: Ο(n2)   

     - `Insertion Sort`:  It works by comparing an element with the elements to its left, until it reaches an element that is smaller than it; the element is then inserted in front of the smaller element.
        -  `Time complexity`: Ο(n2)
